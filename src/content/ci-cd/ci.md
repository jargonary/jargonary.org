title: "Continuous Integration"
acronym: "CI"
definition: "Continuous Integration is a software development strategy that increases the speed of development while ensuring the quality of the code that teams deploy. Developers continually commit code in small increments (at least daily, or even several times a day), which is then automatically built and tested before it is merged with the shared repository."

title: "Blue-Green Deployments"
acronym: ""
definition: "Highly available deployment pattern where there are two copies of a service/production environment. Only one is live at a time, and the non-live environment is the one that's upgraded before it becomes live and the other goes to standby. Advantage is less down-time, if any, but disadvantage is increased infrastructure costs."
